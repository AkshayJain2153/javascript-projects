// Run this sample code as-is and examine the output. 
// Should the shuttle have launched? 
// It should not launch beacuse the fuelLevel is below 20000 but in our second if-else loop chnaged the launchReady flag to true. Because of that 3rd loop executed.

// Did it?
// Yes it is launched but it shouldn't we have to correct in 2nd loop using if elseif else loop

// Do not worry about fixing the code yet, we will do that in the next series of exercises.
